First course on algorithms / basic structures.
	We study asymptotic analysis, two types of linked lists, dynamic arrays, stacks, two types of queues, ordered lists, hash tables, associative arrays, sets and caches, with elements from CMU and SHAD courses. In the Carnegie Mellon course, these are Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Priority Queues and Heaps, Sets, Maps and Hashing.
